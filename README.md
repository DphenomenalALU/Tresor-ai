## üìö Challenges & How I Overcame Them

### Challenge 1: Separating the front-end and back-end

Initially, the project was a monolith. I needed to separate the client and server logic to deploy securely and scale efficiently. This required:

- Refactoring fetch URLs to use full API base paths
- Setting up proper CORS handling
- Ensuring static assets were served separately

**Solution:** Used Render for the back-end and my web servers for the front-end. Rewrote API endpoints and used environment variables to manage base URLs.

---

### Challenge 2: Streaming responses from Groq

Groq's API supports SSE (Server-Sent Events), but integrating it with the front-end while keeping UI responsive was tricky.

**Solution:** Leveraged the `TextDecoder` API and `ReadableStream` to handle incoming chunks of data and update the UI incrementally.

---

### Challenge 3: Securely handling Google OAuth

OAuth flows often break if redirect URIs or environment variables are misconfigured.

**Solution:** I carefully matched redirect URIs in the Google Cloud Console with `APP_URL` on Render. I also used `google-auth-library` for token verification.

---

### Challenge 4: Local data persistence

Since I promised privacy, everything had to be stored locally. Managing user state, threads, and message history with `localStorage` while keeping things fast and clean was challenging.

**Solution:** Implemented a lightweight state management pattern and added autosave logic. Added UI features like favorites and filters without needing a database.
